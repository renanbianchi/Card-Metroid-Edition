# Welcome-Card-Metroid-Edition

This is a Welcome Card developed for learning purposes. Feel Free to use the code.

There is some code marked as comment if you want to use the card and to replace my info with anything you'd like (i.e. all your github info. )

1 - To use it, just remove the comment on Line 70 on index.html to enable the javascript.

2 - On Main.JS fill the '' with your username example: 'renanbianchi' on github. Note that yotube you might want to paste your whole channel address.

Note: If you have not filled all your github info, it'll robably return blank.
